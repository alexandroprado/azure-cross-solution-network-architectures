# Network Troubleshooting
This is a collection of errors (and corresponding troubleshooting tip) at various stages across the different scenarios during the deployment.

# Network Connectivity Status

Verify Network connectivity status. If the status is not healthy review DNS, VPN/Routing, Firewall/NVA design considerations for Internal vs External mode.

# Routing to backend API

Validate routing to the backend API, review NSGs and if firewall /NVA IP needs to be whitelisted

Default domain in external mode fails because the return traffic gets assymetric. Use custom domain when you have a firewall/NVA in the design.
